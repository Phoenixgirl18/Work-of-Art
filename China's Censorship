    <h1><u>How free is China?</u></h1>
        <p>Recently, there's been a issue China has been having between government and the press. China has been cracking 
        down on them to restrict them to give information to the public about what the government is doing. 
        Freedom House Index has ranked China 178 out of 180; this could be, because of the censorship they have on the media.</p>
